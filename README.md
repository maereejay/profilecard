🪪 Profile Card — Stage 0 Task

This is my HNG Internship Stage 0 task, where I built a responsive and accessible Profile Card Component using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project follows the required semantic structure, uses data-testid attributes for testing, and adapts smoothly across screen sizes.

🔧 Features

🧱 Semantic HTML — built with proper tags like <article>, <figure>, <section>, and <nav>.

🧩 Accessible design — all links are keyboard-focusable and include alt text.

📱 Responsive layout — stacks vertically on small screens and side-by-side on larger ones.

⏱️ Live time display — dynamically updates every second using Date() in JavaScript.

🖼️ Profile image, bio, hobbies, and dislikes sections included.

🌐 Social links open safely in a new tab (target="_blank" with rel="noopener noreferrer").
