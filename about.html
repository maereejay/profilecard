    <h2 class="aboutheading">Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my work. Every time i open my work there's always little changes and tweaks i could make to make it better. And sometimes this makes me slow but lately i've decided to do enough and just close the project.

       yours sincerely,
       <br>
       Past self.
